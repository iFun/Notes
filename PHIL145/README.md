## Chapter 1 Defining Science

### what is a demarcation problem

Re-attempt to determine what is science and what is not

1. Science is what scientist do 
    - circular statement since cannot define scientist
    - credentials not working
2. Scientists perform experiment(i.e. manipulating variable in a controlled setting)
    - rules out too much, many science cannot perform experiments
    - too inclusive 
3. Science is what is fallible 
    - Auxiliary Hypotheses(hypothesis other than the test hypothesis which is assumed to be true and is needed to derive the test implication)
4. Science is testable
    - included ways too much
    - many thing is testable(i.e. everything is fallible is testable)
5. Science follows the scientific method
    - circular 
    - relies on testability and fallibility 
    - changing(scientist will use any methods they can prove the theory)

### Problems/lessons

- science is too heterogeneous and too fluid
- cluster concept and sensitive
- ultimately demarcation is trying to do two things
    - A describe
    - B Justify authority
    - if do A delicate salient features, then no justification of authority
    - if do B then lack the resource to differentiate authority

### The Empiricists Attitude

    definition: The idea that observations(data) 
    combined rationality archives reliable knowledge

1. grater observation(lots of them)
2. body of data suggest hypothesis(about the world)
3. hypothesis is tested which will entail more data gathering

## Chapter 2 Naive Empiricism

### 2 challenges

- purity(*reliability*) of observations

- how the reasoning works 

### lots of observations

* hypotheses -> reforming ->new data collection  -> implication or rejection of hypotheses

### Observations are fallible(易错的) 
- quickly far away really small
- not have the right tool to observe
- cannot make a careful enough observation
- need a new tech to overcome the fallible observations
- process of reason can get around the fallibility of observations

### Expectations can affect observations
* Theory-laden observations(NR thanson)
* believe in different hypnosis, observe different things

### Get the problem of fallibility(lower the risk)
- repeat the experiment
- double check the result
- review by others
- scrutinize the experiment
- care

### Evidence of set beliefs affecting systematically the reporting of data

    - need scientific training
    - Saturn and 3 starts(伽利略开始看到的土星是三个star)
    - run thought and double check
    - placebo effect 


### Human assume world going to operating similar fashion in the past, because they operate base on past experience

__Problem__: no way to justify the statement above

Inference and deduction: Arguments in philosophy is a set of statement Many statements are evidence(premises) supporting conclusion, and conclusion support statement 

We give theses to convince others believe in the statement

### Two ways argument can go wrong

- Your evidence could be wrong, so the conclusion is wrong. Thus, the statement is wrong (__bad premises__)

- Premises are irrelevant to the conclusion 

### How does the evidence support the conclusion

- **Deductive arguments**: if premises are true the conclusion cannot be false

- **Inductive argument**: conclusion extends beyond the evidence

Hume's argument: there is **no reason to believe** after 99 instances that 100 instances. (Does not work)

Causal argument: one thing causes another; a hypothesis is an initial speculation about a causal claim. (Does not work)
​    
    we need to observe the cause, but we cannot observe the cause we only see the context of conjunction.
    We need induction to justify 

### Probability(more data high probability)

- does not work because objective fact of probability (measured frequency) -> begging the question
- some model and understanding tie explicitly to the world

### Epistemic values(hacker answer)
- simplicity is what we value 
- does the theory gives explanation and make precise prediction

The theory that is more simple allow us to falsify more easily 

If theory have epistemic value we can start to test it, and the test we have will be more telling. 

### Proof
- A proof is something that establishes conclusion with certainty given axioms(公理) and definitions 
- Establishes to a high degree of certainty or supported by available evidence

Humans like to make inductive inferences but not automatically 

## Chapter 3 

Observe -> generalize -> implication -> deserts & test -> levies -> test 

    - cumulative process
    - everyone can use this method
    - series examination what science currently do and past

### Thomas Kuhm
The structure of scientific revolutions 1962

1. Pre-paradigm science

2. Normal Science

3. Scientific Revolution

### Pre-paradigm Science
    Justify conclusion, method, question, theoretical structure which generate the question you are going to question

    Options before Newton 
    Electricity before Framblim 
    Chemistry before loviosser 
    Heat before caloric 

Some scientific achievement sets a paradigm

A paradigm is an example of how to do things

What constitutes a good question?
What constitute a good answer?
What constitute a good method?

### Experiment work

1. Greater precision 
2. Further articulation of the paradigm
    - finding new physical content
    - develop new quantitate laws
    - new areas of application
3. Direct test of paradigm

### Theoretical work need to solve
1. Generate new predictions
2. Working through implications
3. Reformulation paradigm
4. Work on fit with paradigm and experiment.

No part of the aim normal since new source of pheromone, often not seen at all. Observation can be theory

Not see at all, not recognize as pheromone should be in a paradigm

Anomalies will gather

When the anomalies got too great 

- science reaches state of crisis
- New exemplar!(change the question)

- continually trying to reform the paradigm (new experiment, new methodology) make the anomalies go away(under normal science works)
- A group of people will say anomalies are not assumable by the paradigm  looking for a different way to do things

Changing in paradigm incommensurable 
We can't talk about the progress of science 
We are not getting closer to the truth we are just changing the science we do not have any rule to know the we are closer to the truth 

__Cannot be cumulative__


### Lessons from Kuhm
1. There is no single scientific method
    - historical evidence
    - no simple accumulation of knowledge 
2. Scientific paradigms accepted even though they are incomplete
3. Scientific dogmatism
    - Kuhm: scientist want let paradigm go easily
    - overstatement scientist community affair 
4. Incommensurability: no way possible to determine when you going through paradigm shift whether we have any progress or not

Evidence and reason don't uniquely decide among moderate
That means rational to follow many paradigms

Strong: no rational or evidential basis for selection thus paradigm choice is irrational (decided by other emotional and social factors)

STS

Sociology: attempt to replace phil of science reason and argumentation social influence ambition etc


## Chapter 4
Underdetermination
​            
    In the philosophy of science, underdetermination refers to situations where the evidence available is insufficient to identify which belief we should hold about that evidence.



#### Any set of evidence no matter how large. will not uniquely select a scientific theory

evidence always underdetermine the theory
Science is __fallible__ 

### Strong Program
Science is no better than any other means for forming beliefs about the world

Since evidence doesn't determine theories other factors(social, psychological, emotional) ---> science is irrational


### The value-free ideal

As much as possible science should be free of (non-epistemic) value

Evidence don't get us conclusion (because the problem of induction)

When is there enough evidence to act on? When do we have enough evidence to say smoke causes cancer 

Chance of being wrong



## Midterm review

1. A satisfying solution to the problem of demarcation(界限,划分) remain elusive(难以找到), but we shouldn't be content with dismissing any theory study or method simply because it doesn't fulfil a particular definition  (我们无法找到令人满意划分界限的方法, 但是也不能因此而忽视 simply because it doesn't fulfil a particular definition  )
2. Empircist attitudes(经验主义 又作經驗論，通常指相信现代科学方法，认为理论应建立于对于事物的观察，而不是直觉或迷信。意即通过实验研究而后进行理论归纳优于单纯的逻辑推理。)
3. Our experience are not always reliable indicators of how things are, we should not put too much emphasis how thing appear
4. biases in subjective can be overcome through improved experimental design
5. There might be very good reasons for ignoring certain data, but those reasons may not always be immediately apparent to those who lack relevant training and education
6. Certainty is not something science achieve but absence of certainty is consistent with having lots of compelling evidence for given
7. We continue to learn about how pas experience n better predict future events
8. Scientific methods are them-selves appropriate object of criticism and refinement and the introduction of new methods may entirely justifiable. 
9. All theories confront anomalies, so anomalies alone can't be adequate reasons to dismiss a theory. Theories are pursued, impart, because they offer the most promise for purpose of furthering our understating  
10. Kuhn = 科学家 work within something like a paradigm has historical plausibility but this need not imply strong incommensurability between paradigms
11. Scientific progress is contingent shaped in part by wha problems scientist choose to engage, what technology becomes available, as well as broader socio-economic


## After Exam
human being __habit__ of making induction 

### From early 1980:

        Tendencies & patterns of conclusion cognitive & social psychologists  

        Cognitive biases & hveristes 
        Identified as -> coming to wrong conclusions (in the face of evidences) 


Quick shortcuts in the believe formation

Confirmation is good bias for us 进化学的论点

If there is a Systemic / predictable irrationalities  

100种偏见认知

1.   Conjunction fallacy 合取谬误
      Error is tendency to conclude that multiple option has a higher probability than a component single option

          小明经常对男生淫笑，且经常对男生做出亲密的肢体动作，试问那一种可能性较高？ 1.小明是男性 2.小明是男同性恋
          如果认为是2 就犯了合取谬误。男同性恋意味着是“男性”且是“同性恋”，无论如何，小明符合“男性”的机会一定比符合“男性”又符合“同性恋”的概率更大。

2.   Confirmation bias
              关注、寻找、诠释、记忆资讯的方向多半是能确认自己成见的方向
              Tendency to prefer - or actively seek out evidence that supports, rather than challenges pre-existing beliefs
     - weigh confirming evidence/ discount disconfirm(female drivers)
     - actively seeking out evidence(number game)
     - standard of evidence (capital punishment)
     - even in the face of evidence (suicide notes)

### Availability Heuristic

Tendency to believe something is important if it can be recalled

1. Recent event (after911 plane travel dropped driving increased)
2. Vivid telling 感人的故事
3. Order affect human judgment 
4. Bandwagon effect 随大流
5. Hear more often 

### Overconfidence 

Tendency to conclude if it feels right them it is right

1. Hindsight bias 事后诸葛亮
2. Lake Woebegone effect happens where we believe we are better than others.
3. Coherence kidney tendency to believe something is because a narrow perspective cancer study

### Consequences 

- overestimate our personal understanding of the scientific theories under discussion
- our ability to evaluate conflicting arguments and evidence 
- our ability to ensure that our beliefs aren't being swayed by emotion ro wishful thinking
- influenced by what intuitively seems plausible rather than the evidence suggested 

### Memory

1. Leading question can make/affect memories (How you ask the question)
2. Anecdotal evidence (we see coordination all over the place) 我们记住特别的事件
3. Repeating  information for the sole purpose of discrediting it can have the opposite effect


### Decoy Effect

gives two options 90/10 introduce a third option which makes the second one looks good

result is 50/0/50

### Blind spot bias 
Tendency to believe that biases have no effect on me
We are bad at acknowledging bas in we are good at detecting it in others

Arguments premises & conclusion

The conclusion one argument is the other arguments' premises


### Declarative statement is T or F

4 operators: 

- negation 


- conjunction  
- disjunction 
- material conditional




## Chapter 8 Environmental scare: the case of anthropogenic climate change

Arguments

- History of Climate & temp  
  - __early 1800s: Joseph Fourier found out__
  - plant should be colder than it is from infrared radiation in and out
  - gas in the atmosphere is holding to the heat
  - __mid 180ss: John Tyndall__
  -  CO2, methane, N2o, H2o vapours absorbs infrared radiation-> make plant warmer
  - i.e. greenhouse but very small amount in the air so should not account of for make plant warmer
  - __late 1800 Svante Arrhenius
  - recognized positive feedbacks loop(slight rise in co2 蝴蝶效应 最后产生的能量巨大)
- Short argument for authropocentive CC
- skeptical response
- Created controversy



### Criticism

1. cos absorption saturation causes T increase
2. lots more co2 in minerals and oceans then atmosphere cause extra would be absorbed and no climate impact

1950s Glibert plass atmosphere layered more co2 in upper layer has greater T effect

Roger Ruelle: oceans will absorb lot less co2 than assumed



### lesson history

by 1960: 

1. burning fossil fuel add co2
2. adding co2 to atmosphere will increase the global average T
3. These two thing does not conclusion we as human is changing the climate 
4. we are not produce enough, or the co2 does not accurate in the atmosphere, there maybe something else causing the climate change


### Short argument for ACC (human cause)
Rest on 4 claims

1. Planet is undergoing unusual climate change(rising T)
    - evidence: temp records, glacial retreat, rising sea levels
    - thiner polar ice plant animal ranges changing, warming oceans
2. Green house gasses particularly Co2, are becoming greater in atmosphere due to human activity
    - evidence: atmosphere co2 rising 1958 
    - explain: burning fossil fuels
    - percentage of 14C in atmosphere too low
3. Reason one is due to reason two
    - evidence: climate models

Models are accurate for last 100 years with co2 emissions without co2 emissions it is not accurate

4. Same models predict dire consequences for future generation 
1. not an explanation
2. Models account for all the notable variation

A Temp due to natural variation simple narrative 
    Not an explanation weather
    Models account for all the notable variation

B Oregon Petition

online Bs in medicine engineering biology agriculture math and computer science 
9000 PHD unconformable surveys of abstracts PRJ overwhelming consensus


C General critical thinking

D partial arguments to case doubt

## Chapter 8 Science and religion

### Barbours views 

1. Dramatically opposed(science or religion one of them must be wrong)
2. independent of are one and another 
3. Science is concern with empirical constitution of the universe whereas religion concern with ethical values and spiritual meaning
4. Filling the gaps (science gives answer where religion doesn't have)
5. Integrated relationship (the advantages of each support or cover the disadvantages of the other)
    - scientific discoveries as evidence for the existence of God

### Evolution theory

> Biological evolution 

#### Charles Darwin
> book called Origin of Species

Speciation: species can come into existence 

evolution = Variation and natural selection

Artificially selection (breeding)



## Chapter 10

### HIV&&AIDS
> Acquired immune deficiency syndrome 

Human Immunodeficiency Virus

Virus DNA -> RNA -> proteins

RetroVirus RNA -> DNA -> RNA -> proteins (HIV)
ATZ solved little HIV

Get HIV but no 症状

### Three criteria

Controversy  Motive lifestyle (check book) not very true
Alternative
- should have a positive alternative, but also instead of giving positive alternative they magnify uncertainty  not very true


If there is someone else argument against have self serving motive 
It is a created controversy 

### Motives

    Motives are an indication of Created scientific controversy if all dissenters have a self-serving motive. eThe motive close not need to be the same for all dissenters

### Engagement

    The engagement question the dissenters are to scientific community or to the pub community (Do the have legit scientific peer reviewed)

### Alternative

    Are there any alternative?
    No alternative presented 
    S
### 疫苗
MMR stands for mumps measles rubella

Virus infects the body called antigen(抗原体)

> Vaccines insert parts of viruses that train your immune system

### Uncertainties of Vaccines

1. Harmful side effect

2. We don't know How to make them

Created controversy for argument against Vaccines
Making money (weeks field study, check book)

Alternative (no alternative since didn't play with uncertainty)

Engagement (does not have engagement)

Thus not a created scientific controversy (bad science in practice) for the weeks field study


### GMO(转基因)

Breeding -> Hybridizing(杂交) -> Grafting(嫁接) -> GMOs

### Inserting DNA sequences
1. Gun
2. Bacteria 
3. CRISPR as 9

### Worries about GMO food
1. unnatural  - ick factor
2. Unhealthy/ unsafe (countered by scientific consensus) Created controversy 
3. Unsafe for environment 
4. Corporate control __serious worry__ 







## Exam review

### Question I got wrong
- One reason the argument against anthropogenic climate change that observed temperature increases is due to natural variation is suspect is that:
> it fits with a simple narrative (weather changes all the time) and thus it is possible that we are biased to draw the conclusion

- The practice of testing a model by inserting past data and testing the model predictions against known outcomes is known as: __hidecasting__


- One reason the argument against anthropogenic climate change that observed temperature increases is due to natural variation is suspect is that:
>	it is no explanation at all, since it amounts to saying "the temperature increase is not caused by people"

- For proponents of Intelligent Design, _____________ is an example of when the appearance of design is evidence for actual design.
> 	 irreducible complexity

- Darwin gained the insight that __________________ from Thomas Malthus' Essay on the Principles of Population.
>  population growth rates are always greater than the environment can support

- What unifies proponents of intelligent design?
> The belief that certain biological and cosmological features are the result of intelligent agency


### Possible short answer
We should worry that natural variability isn't an __explanation__ for recent climate change but simply a refusal to countenance the possibility that human activity is to blame

Facts of global warming: 

1. The levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases are increasing.
2. Greenhouse gasses have a warming effect

Oregon Petition is worthless because (投票人为human没有排放很多的温室气体)

1. Survey with people who does not trained in __climatology__
2. Independent efforts to verify that the names on the list are not forgeries have repeatedly failed.(need peer review)


> Naomi Oreskes want to identify the proportion of papers that either endorsed or rejection human-induced climate change(0 papers that argued in opposition)

Average surface temperatures have increased (even 1998 is ht hottest year)


### Why climate change is a created controversy

> Answers are provided but ignored (problems with data, models etc)
> 
> Weak objection being repeated to mislead the public about the state of the science
>
> The majority of climate science scepticism is directed simply towards undermining the prevailing view 


### Evolutionary biology

Core idea = species are not immutable, but undergo change

达尔文的爷爷和Pierre Louis Maupertuis suggested that species might under go changes

Lamarck 也发现了, 但是没有发现现在很多物种有相同的祖先(达尔文发现的)

> Nature selection is about how populations become better adapted to their surroundings


Nilsson and Pelger's model suggested that complex eyes, complete with a sophisticates lens, could evolve form a flat patch of light sensitive cells in less than 400000 years. Which is remarkably fast

A result of __natural variation__ some individuals are better equipped to meet those challenges(大自然选择) => evidence in __fossil genes__

Theories are not promoted to the status of __fact or law__


Human have strong __essentialist__ tendencies when it comes to certain categories(study of children)

### Intellectual Design 

Michael Behe: Improbable for biological systems could have arisen through a sequence of stepwise improvements on earlier versions of that system
