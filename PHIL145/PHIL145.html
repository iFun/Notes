# PHIL 145

## Chapter 1 Defining Science

### what is a demarcation problem

Re-attempt to determine what is science and what is not

1. Science is what scientist do 
    - circular statement since cannot define scientist
    - credentials not working
2. Scientists perform experiment(i.e. manipulating variable in a controlled setting)
    - rules out too much, many science cannot perform experiments
    - too inclusive 
3. Science is what is fallible 
    - Auxiliary Hypotheses(hypothesis other than the test hypothesis which is assumed to be true and is needed to derive the test implication)
4. Science is testable
    - included ways too much
    - many thing is testable(i.e. everything is fallible is testable)
5. Science follows the scientific method
    - circular 
    - relies on testability and fallibility 
    - changing(scientist will use any methods they can prove the theory)

### Problems/lessons

- science is too heterogeneous and too fluid
- cluster concept and sensitive
- ultimately demarcation is trying to do two things
    - A describe
    - B Justify authority
    - if do A delicate salient features, then no justification of authority
    - if do B then lack the resource to differentiate authority

### The Empiricists Attitude

    definition: The idea that observations(data) 
    combined rationality archives reliable knowledge

1. grater observation(lots of them)
2. body of data suggest hypothesis(about the world)
3. hypothesis is tested which will entail more data gathering

## Chapter 2 Naive Empiricism

### 2 challenges

- purity(*reliability*) of observations

- how the reasoning works 

### lots of observations

* hypotheses -> reforming ->new data collection  -> implication or rejection of hypotheses

### Observations are fallible(易错的) 
- quickly far away really small
- not have the right tool to observe
- cannot make a careful enough observation
- need a new tech to overcome the fallible observations
- process of reason can get around the fallibility of observations

### Expectations can affect observations
* Theory-laden observations(NR thanson)
* believe in different hypnosis, observe different things

### Get the problem of fallibility(lower the risk)
- repeat the experiment
- double check the result
- review by others
- scrutinize the experiment
- care

### Evidence of set beliefs affecting systematically the reporting of data

    - need scientific training
    - Saturn and 3 starts(伽利略开始看到的土星是三个star)
    - run thought and double check
    - placebo effect 

 
### Human assume world going to operating similar fashion in the past, because they operate base on past experience

__Problem__: no way to justify the statement above

Inference and deduction: Arguments in philosophy is a set of statement Many statements are evidence(premises) supporting conclusion, and conclusion support statement 

We give theses to convince others believe in the statement

### Two ways argument can go wrong

- Your evidence could be wrong, so the conclusion is wrong. Thus, the statement is wrong (__bad premises__)

- Premises are irrelevant to the conclusion 

### How does the evidence support the conclusion

- **Deductive arguments**: if premises are true the conclusion cannot be false

- **Inductive argument**: conclusion extends beyond the evidence

Hume's argument: there is **no reason to believe** after 99 instances that 100 instances. (Does not work)

Causal argument: one thing causes another; a hypothesis is an initial speculation about a causal claim. (Does not work)
    
    we need to observe the cause, but we cannot observe the cause we only see the context of conjunction.
    We need induction to justify 

### Probability(more data high probability)

- does not work because objective fact of probability (measured frequency) -> begging the question
- some model and understanding tie explicitly to the world

### Epistemie values(hacker answer)
- simplicity is what we value 
- does the theory gives explanation and make precise prediction

The theory that is more simple allow us to falsify more easily 

If theory have epistemic value we can start to test it, and the test we have will be more telling. 

### Proof
- A proof is something that establishes conclusion with certainty given axioms(公理) and definitions 
- Establishes to a high degree of certainty or supported by available evidence

Humans like to make inductive inferences but not automatically 

## Chapter 3 

Observe -> generalize -> implication -> deserts & test -> levies -> test 

    - cumulative process
    - everyone can use this method
    - serise examination what science currently do and past

### Thomas Kuhm
The structure of scientific revolutions 1962

1. Pre-paradigm science

2. Normal Science

3. Scientific Revolution

### Pre-paradigm Science
    Justify conclusion, method, question, theoretical structure which generate the question you are going to question
    
    Options before Newton 
    Electricity before Framblim 
    Chemistry before loviosser 
    Heat before caloric 
    
Some scientific achievement sets a paradigm

A paradigm is an example of how to do things

What constitutes a good question?
What constitute a good answer?
What constitute a good method?

### Experiment work

1. Greater precision 
2. Further articulation of the paradigm
    - finding new physical content
    - develop new quantitate laws
    - new areas of application
3. Direct test of paradigm

### Theoretical work need to solve
1. Generate new predictions
2. Working through implications
3. Reformulation paradigm
4. Work on fit with paradigm and experiment.

No part of the aim normal since new source of pheromone, often not seen at all. Observation can be theory

Not see at all, not recognize as pheromone should be in a paradigm

Anomalies will gather

When the anomalies got too great 

- science reaches state of crisis
- New exemplar!(change the question)

- continually trying to reform the paradigm (new experiment, new methodology) make the anomalies go away(under normal science works)
- A group of people will say anomalies are not assumable by the paradigm  looking for a different way to do things

Changing in paradigm incommensurable 
We can't talk about the progress of science 
We are not getting closer to the truth we are just changing the science we do not have any rule to know the we are closer to the truth 

__Cannot be cumulative__


### Lessons from Kuhm
1. There is no single scientific method
    - historical evidence
    - no simple accumulation of knowledge 
2. Scientific paradigms accepted even though they are incomplete
3. Scientific dogmatism
    - Kuhm: scientist want let paradigm go easily
    - overstatement scientist community affair 
4. Incommensurate: no way possible to determine when you going through paradigm shift whether we have any progress or not

Evidence and reason don't uniquely decide among moderate
That means rational to follow many paradigms

Strong: no rational or evidential basis for selection thus paradigm choice is irrational (decided by other emotional and social factors)

STS

Sociology: attempt to replace phil of science reason and argumentation social influence ambition etc

## Chapter 4
Underdetermination
            
    In the philosophy of science, underdetermination refers to situations where the evidence available is insufficient to identify which belief we should hold about that evidence.



#### Any set of evidence no matter how large. will not uniquely select a scientific theory

evidents always underdetermine the theory
Science is __fallible__ 

### Strong Program
Science is no better than any other means for forming beliefs about the world

Since evidence doesn't determine theories other factors(social, psychological, emotional) ---> science is irrational


### The value-free ideal

As much as possible science should be free of (non-epistemic) value

Evidence don't get us conclusion (because the problem of induction)

When is there enough evidence to act on? When do we have enough evidence to say smoke causes cancer 

Chance of being wrong



## Midterm review

1. A satisfying solution to the problem of demarcation(界限,划分) remain elusive(难以找到), but we shouldn't be content with dismissing any theory study or method simply because it doesn't fulfil a particular definition  (我们无法找到令人满意划分界限的方法, 但是也不能因此而忽视 simply because it doesn't fulfil a particular definition  )
2. Empircist attitudes(经验主义 又作經驗論，通常指相信现代科学方法，认为理论应建立于对于事物的观察，而不是直觉或迷信。意即通过实验研究而后进行理论归纳优于单纯的逻辑推理。)
3. Our experience are not always reliable indicators of how things are, we should not put too much emphasis how thing appear
4. biases in subjective can be overcome through improved experimental design
5. There might be very good reasons for ignoring certain data, but those reasons may not always be immediately apparent to those who lack relevant training and education
6. Certainty is not something science achieve but absence of certainty is consistent with having lots of compelling evidence for given
7. We continue to learn about how pas experience n better predict future events
8. Scientific methods are them-selves appropriate object of criticism and refinement and the introduction of new methods may entirely justifiable. 
9. All theories confront anomalies, so anomalies alone can't be adequate reasons to dismiss a theory. Theories are pursued, inpart, because they offer the most promise for purpose of furthering our understating  
10. Kuhn = 科学家 work within something like a paradigm has historical plausibility but this need not imply strong incommensurebility between paradigms
11. Scientific progress is contingent shaped in part by wha tproblems scientist choose to engage, what technology becomes avaible, as well as broader socio-economic and political fre
