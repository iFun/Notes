## Chapter 1 Defining Science

### what is a demarcation problem

Re-attempt to determine what is science and what is not

1. Science is what scientist do 
    - circular statement since cannot define scientist
    - credentials not working
2. Scientists perform experiment(i.e. manipulating variable in a controlled setting)
    - rules out too much, many science cannot perform experiments
    - too inclusive 
3. Science is what is fallible 
    - Auxiliary Hypotheses(hypothesis other than the test hypothesis which is assumed to be true and is needed to derive the test implication)
4. Science is testable
    - included ways too much
    - many thing is testable(i.e. everything is fallible is testable)
5. Science follows the scientific method
    - circular 
    - relies on testability and fallibility 
    - changing(scientist will use any methods they can prove the theory)

### Problems/lessons

- science is too heterogeneous and too fluid
- cluster concept and sensitive
- ultimately demarcation is trying to do two things
    - A describe
    - B Justify authority
    - if do A delicate salient features, then no justification of authority
    - if do B then lack the resource to differentiate authority

### The Empiricists Attitude

    definition: The idea that observations(data) 
    combined rationality archives reliable knowledge

1. grater observation(lots of them)
2. body of data suggest hypothesis(about the world)
3. hypothesis is tested which will entail more data gathering

## Chapter 2 Naive Empiricism

### 2 challenges

- purity(*reliability*) of observations

- how the reasoning works 

### lots of observations

* hypotheses -> reforming ->new data collection  -> implication or rejection of hypotheses

### Observations are fallible(易错的) 
- quickly far away really small
- not have the right tool to observe
- cannot make a careful enough observation
- need a new tech to overcome the fallible observations
- process of reason can get around the fallibility of observations

### Expectations can affect observations
* Theory-laden observations(NR thanson)
* believe in different hypnosis, observe different things

### Get the problem of fallibility(lower the risk)
- repeat the experiment
- double check the result
- review by others
- scrutinize the experiment
- care

### Evidence of set beliefs affecting systematically the reporting of data

    - need scientific training
    - Saturn and 3 starts(伽利略开始看到的土星是三个star)
    - run thought and double check
    - placebo effect 

 
### Human assume world going to operating similar fashion in the past, because they operate base on past experience

__Problem__: no way to justify the statement above

Inference and deduction: Arguments in philosophy is a set of statement Many statements are evidence(premises) supporting conclusion, and conclusion support statement 

We give theses to convince others believe in the statement

### Two ways argument can go wrong

- Your evidence could be wrong, so the conclusion is wrong. Thus, the statement is wrong (__bad premises__)

- Premises are irrelevant to the conclusion 

### How does the evidence support the conclusion

- **Deductive arguments**: if premises are true the conclusion cannot be false

- **Inductive argument**: conclusion extends beyond the evidence

Hume's argument: there is no reason to believe after 99 instances that 100 instances.

Causal argument: one thing causes another; a hypothesis is an initial speculation about a causal claim.
    
    we need to observe the cause, but we cannot observe the cause we only see the context or conjunction.
    We need induction to justify
