## Sampling Data

> Heart of statistical reasoning
Idea take a small sample of a large population

Find out something about the sample conclude it would for large population

### A good sample is representative of the large population 

> Its if ways sample can be biased: 
> 
>  __fail__ to representative of the large population that in way


#### Example of bias data

Average Yale man of class of 24 makes 25,111/year (1954)

220,794(in 2016 inflation take into account)

The way of collecting data: Yale sends out questionnaire

1. Who is going to response
2. Who gets questionnaire

### The gold standard of sample: Random sample

> Does every name or thing in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample 

However random sample are expensive!

So instead of asking every person in US who to vote

The method is __stratified random sample__

> proportions of important in the population make sure proportions are same in sample random match the poportions

### Mean: mathematical average 
    SUM/TOTAL#

### Median: mid point of value
    
    1/2 value above
    1/2 value below



### Mode: most frequent value (Page35)
    
    
## Chapter 3


### Sample size 
larger the sample the better
small sample: non-repsentative results
    
report on trail without sample size can be dangerous

1 time 80% head: report this is biased coin

When testing rare things, sample size has to be larger


Chance of feature in sample occurring randomly => statistical significance 



### Spread of data

Avg family is 3.6 people

We build 2 bed room houses

Lots of family with no kids, and some family with lots of kids

## Chapter 4

Little difference mean nothing 

IQ 98+3 L 101+3 IQ test


### Reader Digest smoke rank
All cigarettes are basically the same, but old gold at the bottom rank(still same maybe 0.001 differences)

OLD GOLD say they have the least of these undesirable things in its smoke, excluded were all figures and any hint that the difference was negligible

## Chapter 5 Graphs

Using graph to manipulate 


## Chapter 6 Pictograms

> careful with the area(how much space the picture takes)

Use __3D__ Pie chart to lie information 


## Chapter 7

Putting number on things make it more legit(gives authority)

But numbers can mean one thing and be used to imply another

- semi-attached to the information you really want to know -> 26%more juice (more than what)

- 4 times more car accidents on clear days than foggy days, clear days are much more than foggy days

- Death rate for the Navy in Spanish American War (9/10000), NYC(16/1000) -> older generation not counted in Navy
  

### The choice of colour can make area looks bigger

## Chapter 8

### Correlation does not mean causation

- Coincidence
- common cause


- woman example (age causes toe angle to increase)
    - because before woman talking with a wide angle of feet

Use graph

Trending one causes another trend


## Chapter 9

Statisticulation = statistical manipulation

- intent(恶意为之) or incompetence 
- huff: as long as errors remain are sided, hard to call it accidental

- all writing has a purpose the error has are against want see print

### Maps

Area interoperate as quantity 

Pay attention to how number are calculated
    
- 3100 --- median
- 5004, total income/total population * 4

- percentages
    - confusion of base
    - shifting bases 
    - adding % 
        - material cost going up 10%
        - labor cost going up 10%
        - overhead going up 10%
        - so total is 30%

## Chapter 10 How to talk back to states

1. Who says so(who gives the information)
    - check for bias, motive
    - keep in mind Ok names
2. How do they know
    - what is the process that produced the data
        - sample big enough?
        - sample biased?
3. Whats missing?
    - sample size?
    - unspecified average
    - percents with wrong bases
    - other factors

4. Did somebody change the subject?
    - Do the number and figure and chart are given represent the conclusion the want to draw
    - changes in how numbers were gathered
    - apples and oranges
5. Does it make sense?
    - reflect and look at implications
        - 8m cases of prostate cancer -> 1.1case/made of age
        - Trends don't last forever
