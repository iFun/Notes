## Sampling Data

> Heart of statistical reasoning
Idea take a small sample of a large population

Find out something about the sample conclude it would for large population

### A good sample is representative of the large population 

> Its if ways sample can be biased: 
> 
>  __fail__ to representative of the large population that in way


#### Example of bias data

Average Yale man of class of 24 makes 25,111/year (1954)

220,794(in 2016 inflation take into account)

The way of collecting data: Yale sends out questionnaire

1. Who is going to response
2. Who gets questionnaire

### The gold standard of sample: Random sample

> Does every name or thing in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample 

However random sample are expensive!

So instead of asking every person in US who to vote

The method is __stratified random sample__

> proportions of important in the population make sure proportions are same in sample random match the poportions
