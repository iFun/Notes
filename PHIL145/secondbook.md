## Sampling Data

> Heart of statistical reasoning
Idea take a small sample of a large population

Find out something about the sample conclude it would for large population

### A good sample is representative of the large population 

> Its if ways sample can be biased: 
> 
>  __fail__ to representative of the large population that in way


#### Example of bias data

Average Yale man of class of 24 makes 25,111/year (1954)

220,794(in 2016 inflation take into account)

The way of collecting data: Yale sends out questionnaire

1. Who is going to response
2. Who gets questionnaire

### The gold standard of sample: Random sample

> Does every name or thing in the whole group have an equal chance to be in the sample 

However random sample are expensive!

So instead of asking every person in US who to vote

The method is __stratified random sample__

> proportions of important in the population make sure proportions are same in sample random match the poportions

### Mean: mathematical average 
    SUM/TOTAL#

### Median: mid point of value
    
    1/2 value above
    1/2 value below



### Mode: most frequent value (Page35)
    
    
## Chapter 3


### Sample size 
larger the sample the better
small sample: non-repsentative results
    
report on trail without sample size can be dangerous

1 time 80% head: report this is biased coin

When testing rare things, sample size has to be larger


Chance of feature in sample occurring randomly => statistical significance 



### Spread of data

Avg family is 3.6 people

We build 2 bed room houses

Lots of family with no kids, and some family with lots of kids

## Chapter 4

Little difference mean nothing 

IQ 98+3 L 101+3 IQ test


### Reader Digest smoke rank
All cigarettes are basically the same, but old gold at the bottom rank(still same maybe 0.001 differences)

OLD GOLD say they have the least of these undesirable things in its smoke, excluded were all figures and any hint that the difference was negligible
